## Getting Started

### Running the Application in Docker

This application is containerized using Docker. To build and run the application in a Docker container, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nestjs-app.git
cd nestjs-app
```

## 2. Installation

To install all the dependencies, use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build and Run the Application

Use Docker Compose to build and run the application along with the MongoDB service:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

If need to only to up the container of MongoDB service or the application separated, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose up nestjs-app --build
```

And run the mongo service app:

```bash
docker compose up mongo --build
```

docker-compose up --build -d ?????? testar isso aqui depois

### 4. Access the Application

Once the containers are up and running, you can access your NestJS application at:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

The MongoDB database will be running at:

```bash
mongodb://localhost:27017
```

### 5. Stop the Containers

When you're done, you can stop and remove the running containers by executing:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command will stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

## Additional Commands

### Rebuild the Containers

If you need to rebuild the containers without caching, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate --no-deps

```

### View Logs

To view the logs of the running containers:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Database Modeling

## Authentication

If your API requires authentication, ensure you include the necessary headers or tokens in your requests.

## Postman Collections

- Import the Collection: You can import this collection into Postman by using the Import feature in Postman and selecting the JSON file of this collection.
- Run Requests: Use Postman to run requests against your API endpoints, test different scenarios, and view responses.
